# Vision_app_Compsoft_internship
This application was enhanced by me using a pre-trained model. This application is for the visually impaired and it helped us in understanding text-to-speech conversion and real-time image recognition. The most important feature was the currency recognition feature than recognized Indian and Thai currencies. 
I used the pre-trained model called MobileNetV2 that i used on the currency recognition feature to increase it's accuracy from 70% to 83%. I also learnt reporting this entire process in a neat report.
